# Mentoring Conversation Suggestions

When meeting with an unfamiliar person it can be hard to start or restart mentorship.

- What do you usually look to get out of a mentorship experience?
- What do you see as good qualities for a mentor?
- What are your strengths, what are your opportunities for improvement, what are you doing about it to improve?

To build personal relationship, there needs to be trust between people. This trust over time fosters an environment for deeper discussion. Start by finding things in common with one another.

- What are some hobbies you have tried or wanted to pursue?
- Who do you spend your time with such as family/friends/pets?
- Favorite movies/music/tv shows/books
- What you do for fun?

Reciprocal discussion regarding professional development / career

- Discuss what jobs you have worked or are interested in learning about. What drew or draws you to these?
- How has your communication style changed over time?
- What is a piece of career advice you often hear but might not always agree with? Why?
- How do our roles relate to each other?
- Do you foresee any recently “viral” technologies impacting your job function in the future?
- What perceptions do you often hear regarding some recent new technologies (ex. electric vehicles, AI). Why do you think you often hear this perception, and do you agree with it?

Discuss social issues and develop understanding of other perspectives:

- What are some of the frustrations you experience, whether during or outside of work?
- What are some challenges you see at Dow or outside of Dow?
- Discuss different communication platforms and which you typically use for which purpose
- Do you have any advice on how to improve some of your interactions with the other generations?
- Discuss volunteering opportunities- is there any opportunity to volunteer together for some cause
